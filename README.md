# 5-qubit-QEC-with-random-Pauli-error
This code ouputs a quantum circuit that prepares (not necessarily fault tolerantly) the logical state,$|x_L\rangle$, for the $5$-qubit code, runs it through a random Pauli error channel, with error rate $p$ , measures syndromes and applies the recovery operations (if needed.)
